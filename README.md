## What is inKino?

inKino is a minimal app for browsing movies and showtimes for Finnkino cinemas. It's made with [Flutter](https://flutter.io/), uses `flutter_redux`,  and has an extensive set of unit and widget tests. It also has smooth transition animations and handles offline use cases gracefully.

While I built inKino for my own needs, it is also intented to showcase good app structure and a clean, well-organized Flutter codebase.

## Building the project

The project won't build unless you add the following file manually:

**lib/tmdb_config.dart**

```dart
class TMDBConfig {
  /// The TMDB API is mostly used for loading actor avatars.
  ///
  /// Having a real API key here is optional; if this doesn't 
  /// contain the real API key, the app will still work, but 
  /// the actor avatars won't load.
  static final String apiKey = '<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>';
}
```
